Place a background music MP3 named `bg-music.mp3` in this folder.
Suggested steps:
1. Add your MP3 file and name it `bg-music.mp3`.
2. Supported formats: .mp3 is best for broad browser support.
3. File path must be: assets/audio/bg-music.mp3
4. If playback fails, check browser autoplay policies — some browsers block audio until user interaction.

You can replace the file with any short festive loop. Keep the file size reasonable (<5MB) for faster load.
